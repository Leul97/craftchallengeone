/* Craft challenge 1 */
I handle both cases of challenge one on a single mule project.

Send the following url to check the first case http://localhost:8081/companyinfo/json

Send the following url to check the second case http://localhost:8081/companyinfo/string

I did the project for general input cade. There is a pre-defined file in the project 
resource directory named sample_input, you can change the content not the structure and see the result.
